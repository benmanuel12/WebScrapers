# WebScrapers

This contains the code for some web scrapers for a web development third year project using Selenium and Java
It scrapes 5 different trading card websites for the prices of single cards from a specific set of Magic: The Gathering
Paired with https://github.com/benmanuel12/Comparison_API for the front and back end UI code

To run:
1) Install Java
2) Install Maven
3) Compile it using Maven
4) Run the project

Disclaimer: It may no longer work in the event that the sites it scrapes have changed their layout. It worked fine when I handed the project in.
